# test-protobuf

Test of nested repeated protobuf messages.

In this example, it works with [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) [3.0.0](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/v3.0.0) and [protobuf-c](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c) [1.2.1](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/tree/v1.2.1).


## BONUS
[CMake](http://cmake.org) ready-to-use modules to add protobuf and protobuf-c to your projects.

## TODO 
Add cross compilation to the CMake module.
